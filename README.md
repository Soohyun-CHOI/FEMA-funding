# FEMA Natural Disaster Relief Funding Predictive Model

This repository contains an advanced predictive model that leverages FEMA datasets and economic indicators to forecast funding requirements for natural disaster response initiatives in the United States. Our goal is to provide a tool that aids in anticipating the financial aspects of disaster response, thereby assisting in more effective and timely resource allocation.
